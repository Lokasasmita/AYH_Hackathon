It is the conceptual foudation we have for the backend of our project myfinancepal
This is not a complete backend, its more of "pseudocode" since as first years we still don't have that great of programming knowledge

it aims to show what our project, myfinancepal, would be able to do, such as:
- Adding expenses
- Deleting expenses
- Editing expenses
- Viewing expenses (all, by category, by date)
